I'm interested in things like Fst and homozygosity as those are classic population genetics values that I do'nt know how to calculate yet
Relatedness and GWAS stuff is useful for me although I would hope it won't change how I did my own analysis too much haha
PCA and population structure are also things I've been teaching myself but would love to learn more about
